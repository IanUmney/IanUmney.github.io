            <p>Ian, </p>
            <p>I was a volunteer with WAR for 3 weeks last fall, September-October. I also fundraised $5,400 for WAR in which I personally put into the Free Store account back in the states. Yes I have the receipts for those deposits. When all of this started, I really believed that Ben was legit. Now, I don't think so. I have asked for receipts on December 26, 2024 while having a telephone conversation and again a couple of months ago in another telephone conversation. The last conversation turned into a shouting match.</p>
            <p>I would like to know how my money was spent. I raised around $3,400 on GiveSendGo,my church donated around $1000, and I personally gave $1000 when I returned in October 2024 from Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Ben has blocked me from his Facebook site and TikTok because I want to see evidence of how the money was spent!</p>
            <p>During my three weeks in Kherson, no money was spent on food or supplies for the Free Store. I know for a fact, because I helped pick it up. That we received hundreds of boxes of quick bake cookies from a warehouse in Lutsk, Ukraine. Myself and John Gardner used the two ambulances to pick this up.</p>
            <p>Ben also talked about a church that was donating food that Samaritans Purse had donated. Much of the food at the Free Store was out of date.</p>
            <p>While working at the Free Store I noticed that no money was spent even when we low on food supplies.</p>
            <p>In closing, I will send you copies of the deposits that I made to WAR!</p>
            <p>Thank you,</p>
            <p>Jeff Barrett </p>
