      <h1>World Aid Runners Public Disclosure Case</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.worldaidrunners.org/"><strong>World Aid Runners</strong></a>, a registered <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/private-foundations"><strong>501(c)(3) private foundation</strong></a>, was granted IRS tax-exempt status on <strong>February 27, 2023</strong>.
          As a nonprofit, it is <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations/life-cycle-of-a-private-foundation-required-filings">legally required</a> to make specific documents available to the public upon request.
        </p>
      </section>
<br>
      <section id="reasoning">
        <h2>Why There Is Concern</h2>
        <p>Multiple individuals have independently raised concerns about the conduct of the charity's representative based on direct interactions and patterns of behavior that raise red flags. While each person may have a different reason, together these accounts suggest a potential pattern of mismanagement or dishonesty.</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Despite repeated requests, legally required financial documents have not been provided, even after deadlines and follow-up attempts.</li>
          <li><strong>Inconsistent Communication:</strong> Emails and messages are often ignored or met with vague responses, which delays resolution and transparency.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Independent Complaints:</strong> Separate individuals have come forward with concerns ranging from misuse of funds to misleading statements, with no clear accountability or oversight in place.</li>
          <li><strong>Defensiveness or Retaliation:</strong> Some people have reported that raising concerns results in being blocked or shut down rather than addressed constructively, which can be a warning sign.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>Taken together, these actions form a reasonable basis for the public to ask serious questions and demand transparency. While no one is accusing with certainty, the behavior justifies scrutiny, especially for a tax-exempt organization entrusted with public donations.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <p>

        </p>
        
        <p>Dear sir/madam:</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent email to the WAR website email.  I am currently in country.  We are a small, grass roots organization generally funded by me, with some support from a small group of private donors.  We don't have full time admin staff and are based in Kherson in the "red zone" at the front, where the intensity of the theatre and unreliable comms present additonal challenges.  There are often long delays in attending to emails, especially when I am in country.  I check the email very irregularly, as we have very little correspondence send to the email address.  The nature of our frontline work and extreme forward location make attending to administrative correspondence a secondary priority that must generally wait until we are no longer in-country and in a position to address it.  </p>
        <p>We do not respond to correspondence that is anonymous, for legal and other security reasons.  So, first, you will need to identify yourself and a verifiable identity before I can respond, as a matter of policy.  So please do so, and I will endeavor to address your request, as far as I understand it.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your correspondence.</p>
        <p>Regards, <br>Ben Dusing <br>Co-Founder and Director<br> WAR</p>

      <h2>Are Anonymous Requests Allowed?</h2>
      <section id="anonymous-requests" class="highlight">
        <p>Yes. Under U.S. federal law, you have the legal right to request documents from tax-exempt charities anonymously. Organizations cannot demand your name, reason for inquiry, or any identifying information.</p>
      
        <h3>Legal Sources:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>26 CFR § 301.6104(d)-1(a)(1):</strong>
            <em>“A tax-exempt organization must honor a request... regardless of the identity of the requester.”</em><br>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IRS EO Guide for Public Charities:</strong>
            <em>“The organization may not require a person requesting a copy... to provide personal identification.”</em><br>

        </ul>
      
        <p>This means <strong>anyone</strong> — regardless of citizenship or reason — can submit a valid request, and the organization must respond within 30 days.</p>

      <h2>What Actions Are Illegal in This Situation?</h2>
      <section id="illegal-actions" class="warn">
        <p>If a charity officer or representative fails to follow federal disclosure laws, they may be in violation of IRS Code §6104(d). Here are examples of actions that are not permitted:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Refusing to provide required documents:</strong> It is illegal to deny access to Form 990-PF, Form 1023, or the IRS Determination Letter.</li>
          <li><strong>Delaying beyond 30 days:</strong> For written requests, failure to respond within 30 days can trigger a $20/day fine, up to $10,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Demanding personal information:</strong> Asking for your name, reason for the request, or any identification is not allowed.</li>
          <li><strong>Overcharging for document copies:</strong> Only actual reproduction and mailing costs may be charged—excessive fees are not permitted.</li>
          <li><strong>Providing incomplete or altered records:</strong> Supplying redacted or falsified documents violates IRS rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Not allowing in-person access:</strong> If the organization has a physical office, it must provide access to records during regular business hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Retaliation or harassment:</strong> Threatening, intimidating, or retaliating against a requester is unlawful and may lead to further consequences.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring IRS follow-up:</strong> Failure to cooperate after a Form 13909 complaint can result in audits, penalties, or loss of tax-exempt status.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>These actions can result in IRS penalties and public accountability. All tax-exempt organizations are legally obligated to comply with public transparency laws.</p>
