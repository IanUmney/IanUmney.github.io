          This page is dedicated to raising awareness about the <strong>World Aid Runners</strong> organisation and its public 
          disclosure obligations.
          It serves as a repository for individuals who have concerns with the organisation. It is also designed to be a place 
          to display their responses or reactions.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.worldaidrunners.org/"><strong>World Aid Runners</strong></a>, a registered <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/private-foundations"><strong>501(c)(3) private foundation</strong></a>, was granted IRS tax-exempt status on <strong>February 27, 2023</strong>.
          As a nonprofit, it is <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations/life-cycle-of-a-private-foundation-required-filings">legally required</a> to make specific documents available to the public upon request. After simply asking for these documents, along with other questions, members of the public have been shamed, berated, and left feeling threatened by the organisation's representatives.
        </p>

        <h2>Who is Behind World Aid Runners?</h2>
        <p><a href="/trustaid/bendusing.html">Benjamin G Dusing</a> | Main founder and investor of World Aid Runners.</p>
        <p><a href="/trustaid/bendusing.html#JG">John W. Gardner</a> | Field Director</p>
       
        <small><p>William J. Waggoner | <a href="/trustaid/responses.html#coinvest">Co-founder and co-investor</a></p> </small>

      <section id="reasoning">
        <h2>Why There Is Concern</h2>
        <p>Multiple individuals have independently raised concerns about the conduct of the charity's representative based on direct interactions and patterns of behavior that raise red flags. While each person may have a different reason, together these accounts suggest a potential pattern of mismanagement or dishonesty.</p>
      
        <ul class="warn">
          <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Despite repeated requests, legally required financial documents have not been provided, even after deadlines and follow-up attempts.</li>
          <li><strong>Inconsistent Communication:</strong> Emails and messages are often ignored or met with vague responses, which delays resolution and transparency.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Independent Complaints:</strong> Separate individuals have come forward with concerns ranging from misuse of funds to misleading statements, with no clear accountability or oversight in place.</li>
          <li><strong>Defensiveness or Retaliation:</strong> Some people have reported that raising concerns results in being blocked or shut down rather than addressed constructively, which can be a warning sign.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>Taken together, these actions form a reasonable basis for the public to ask serious questions and demand transparency. While no one is accusing with certainty, the behavior justifies scrutiny, especially for a tax-exempt organization entrusted with public donations.</p>

        <h2>What the Law Requires</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            Under <strong>IRS Code Sections 6104 and 6652(c)</strong>, the foundation must provide the following documents:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The IRS Determination Letter</li>
            <li>The Form 1023 (application for tax exemption)</li>
            <li>Form 990-PF for the past three years</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Documents must be provided <strong>within 30 days of a written request</strong>. On day 31, a fine of $20 per day will start, up to a maximum of $10,000 per violation. If there is a person who willfuly fails to do so, they shall be liable for the fine. The organisation may face tax-exemption revocation.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

  
      
      <h2>Are Anonymous Requests Allowed?</h2>
      <section id="anonymous-requests" class="highlight">
        <p>Yes. Under U.S. federal law, you have the legal right to request documents from tax-exempt charities anonymously. Organizations cannot demand your name, reason for inquiry, or any identifying information.</p>
      
        <h3>Legal Sources:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>26 CFR § 301.6104(d)-1(a)(1):</strong>
            <em>“A tax-exempt organization must honor a request... regardless of the identity of the requester.”</em>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IRS EO Guide for Public Charities:</strong>
            <em>“The organization may not require a person requesting a copy... to provide personal identification.”</em>
            <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4221pc.pdf" target="_blank">See official IRS guide (PDF)</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IRS Form 13909:</strong>
            You may file a complaint anonymously if a nonprofit refuses to comply.

          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>This means <strong>anyone</strong> — regardless of citizenship or reason — can submit a valid request, and the organization must respond within 30 days.</p>

      <h2>What Actions Are Illegal in This Situation?</h2>
      <section id="illegal-actions" class="warn">
        <p>If a charity officer or representative fails to follow federal disclosure laws, they may be in violation of IRS Code §6104(d). Here are examples of actions that are not permitted:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Refusing to provide required documents:</strong> It is illegal to deny access to Form 990-PF, Form 1023, or the IRS Determination Letter.</li>
          <li><strong>Delaying beyond 30 days:</strong> For written requests, failure to respond within 30 days can trigger a $20/day fine, up to $10,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Demanding personal information:</strong> Asking for your name, reason for the request, or any identification is not allowed.</li>
          <li><strong>Overcharging for document copies:</strong> Only actual reproduction and mailing costs may be charged—excessive fees are not permitted.</li>
          <li><strong>Providing incomplete or altered records:</strong> Supplying redacted or falsified documents violates IRS rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Not allowing in-person access:</strong> If the organization has a physical office, it must provide access to records during regular business hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Retaliation or harassment:</strong> Threatening, intimidating, or retaliating against a requester is unlawful and may lead to further consequences.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring IRS follow-up:</strong> Failure to cooperate after a Form 13909 complaint can result in audits, penalties, or loss of tax-exempt status.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>These actions can result in IRS penalties and public accountability. All tax-exempt organizations are legally obligated to comply with public transparency laws.</p>
