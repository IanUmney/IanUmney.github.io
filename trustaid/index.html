      <h1>World Aid Runners Awareness</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          This page is dedicated to raising awareness about the <strong>World Aid Runners</strong> organisation and its public disclosure obligations.
          It serves as a repository for individuals who have concerns with the organisation. It is also designed to be a place to display their responses or reactions.
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.worldaidrunners.org/"><strong>World Aid Runners</strong></a>, a registered <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/private-foundations"><strong>501(c)(3) private foundation</strong></a>, was granted IRS tax-exempt status on <strong>February 27, 2023</strong>.
          As a nonprofit, it is <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/private-foundations/life-cycle-of-a-private-foundation-required-filings">legally required</a> to make specific documents available to the public upon request.
        </p>
        <h2>Who is Responsible?</h2>
        <p>Benjamin G Dusing is the director of World Aid Runners. </p>

        <section class="highlight">
          <h3>Previous Questionable Behaviour</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Misconduct:</strong> Dusing engaged in aggressive, disruptive, and threatening behavior during two family court cases (one with his ex-wife and another with a former partner).</li>
          <li><strong>Facebook Video:</strong> In 2021, Dusing posted a profane, threatening video targeting a judge’s staff attorney and opposing counsel, which the court found highly inappropriate and disruptive to the judicial process.</li>
          <li><strong>Bribery Allegation:</strong> He was found to have directed his co-counsel to offer a psychologist $5,000 to modify a custody evaluation, a serious ethical violation.</li>
          <li><strong>Frivolous Legal Tactics:</strong> Dusing filed numerous baseless motions, appeals, and complaints, many aimed at disrupting proceedings or intimidating other participants.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

       
      </section>
<br>
      <section id="reasoning">
        <h2>Why There Is Concern</h2>
        <p>Multiple individuals have independently raised concerns about the conduct of the charity's representative based on direct interactions and patterns of behavior that raise red flags. While each person may have a different reason, together these accounts suggest a potential pattern of mismanagement or dishonesty.</p>
      
        <ul class="w">
          <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Despite repeated requests, legally required financial documents have not been provided, even after deadlines and follow-up attempts.</li>
          <li><strong>Inconsistent Communication:</strong> Emails and messages are often ignored or met with vague responses, which delays resolution and transparency.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Independent Complaints:</strong> Separate individuals have come forward with concerns ranging from misuse of funds to misleading statements, with no clear accountability or oversight in place.</li>
          <li><strong>Defensiveness or Retaliation:</strong> Some people have reported that raising concerns results in being blocked or shut down rather than addressed constructively, which can be a warning sign.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>Taken together, these actions form a reasonable basis for the public to ask serious questions and demand transparency. While no one is accusing with certainty, the behavior justifies scrutiny, especially for a tax-exempt organization entrusted with public donations.</p>

        <div class="highlight">

            <li>Form 990-PF for the past three years</li>

      <h2>Are Anonymous Requests Allowed?</h2>
      <section id="anonymous-requests" class="highlight">
        <p>Yes. Under U.S. federal law, you have the legal right to request documents from tax-exempt charities anonymously. Organizations cannot demand your name, reason for inquiry, or any identifying information.</p>
      
        <h3>Legal Sources:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>26 CFR § 301.6104(d)-1(a)(1):</strong>
            <em>“A tax-exempt organization must honor a request... regardless of the identity of the requester.”</em><br>
            <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/301.6104(d)-1" target="_blank">Read regulation</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IRS EO Guide for Public Charities:</strong>
            <em>“The organization may not require a person requesting a copy... to provide personal identification.”</em><br>
            <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4221pc.pdf" target="_blank">See official IRS guide (PDF)</a>
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>This means <strong>anyone</strong> — regardless of citizenship or reason — can submit a valid request, and the organization must respond within 30 days.</p>

      <h2>What Actions Are Illegal in This Situation?</h2>
      <section id="illegal-actions" class="warn">
        <p>If a charity officer or representative fails to follow federal disclosure laws, they may be in violation of IRS Code §6104(d). Here are examples of actions that are not permitted:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Refusing to provide required documents:</strong> It is illegal to deny access to Form 990-PF, Form 1023, or the IRS Determination Letter.</li>
          <li><strong>Delaying beyond 30 days:</strong> For written requests, failure to respond within 30 days can trigger a $20/day fine, up to $10,000.</li>
          <li><strong>Demanding personal information:</strong> Asking for your name, reason for the request, or any identification is not allowed.</li>
          <li><strong>Overcharging for document copies:</strong> Only actual reproduction and mailing costs may be charged—excessive fees are not permitted.</li>
          <li><strong>Providing incomplete or altered records:</strong> Supplying redacted or falsified documents violates IRS rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Not allowing in-person access:</strong> If the organization has a physical office, it must provide access to records during regular business hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Retaliation or harassment:</strong> Threatening, intimidating, or retaliating against a requester is unlawful and may lead to further consequences.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring IRS follow-up:</strong> Failure to cooperate after a Form 13909 complaint can result in audits, penalties, or loss of tax-exempt status.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>These actions can result in IRS penalties and public accountability. All tax-exempt organizations are legally obligated to comply with public transparency laws.</p>
