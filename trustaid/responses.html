                <section>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Dusing,</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your response. I appreciate that you are operating in challenging circumstances and have taken time to reply.</p>
                    <p>That said, I want to clarify a few key points and restate my original request for transparency in accordance with federal law.</p>
                    <h2>1. Form 990 Public Disclosure Requirement</h2>
                    <p>
                        Contrary to your statement, it is not inappropriate to request tax return information from a U.S. nonprofit. As you may know, under federal law (Internal Revenue Code § 6104 and corresponding Treasury Regulations), organizations exempt under section 501(c)(3) are legally required to provide copies of their three most recent IRS Form 990 filings upon request. These are public documents and must be disclosed to anyone who asks, without requiring personal identification or justification for the request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your refusal to provide this information is a potential violation of federal law. For reference: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications" target="_blank">IRS Public Disclosure Requirements</a>.
                    </p>
    
                    <h2>2. Tone and Personal Remarks</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your response included several personal and cultural assumptions (e.g., referencing my language background and questioning my motives) that are inappropriate and unprofessional in a public-facing correspondence from a nonprofit leader. I hope we can keep this dialogue focused on facts, compliance, and accountability.
                    </p>
    
                    <h2>3. Governance and Legal Representation</h2>
                    <p>
                        You referenced an “unofficial Board of Advisors” and described your co-founder as both a “co-investor” and legal counsel. For a tax-exempt nonprofit organization, clarity around board governance, financial interests, and legal representation is critical. If World Aid Runners is registered as a 501(c)(3), these elements should be documented and available upon request or filed with the IRS and the State of New Mexico.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>4. Restated Request</h2>
                    <p>
                        Please consider this a formal request under IRS rules for the following documents:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your organization’s most recent Form 990s.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I am not affiliated with any defamatory efforts or campaigns, nor am I making accusations. I am exercising a lawful right to transparency, one that applies to all organisations benefiting from tax-exempt status in the U.S. I am also collating mine, and others’ experiences with yourself and World Aid Runners to determine my course of action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Should I not receive the above documents within a reasonable period, I may submit a report to the IRS and the New Mexico Attorney General's Charities Division, as you yourself suggested, to address any potential compliance concerns.
                    </p>
                    <p>I look forward to your cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Best regards,  
                        <br><strong>Ian Umney</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p><em>Please note:</em> There are other people who are requesting public records from yourself and you should endeavour to reply to them individually with the requested documents.</p>
                    <p>As it is illegal for you to refuse a public request for records, from anyone in the world, even if they wish to be anonymous. It is our legal right to be anonymous, it is not your legal right to refuse us based on that.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Hello.  Again, as I stated in my prior response to your email to our website address, it is our policy not to respond to correspondence from third-parties who do not identify themselves, and if necessary provide sufficient information such that we can confirm who we are corresponding with.  The nature and location of our work presents certain obvious risks and this approach is required to protect our personal and organizational security.  So, again, please identify who and/or what you are.  Frankly, it is disconcerting that you ignored my prior request in this regard.</p>
                    <p id="04">I don’t know you.  I go “Live” on TikTok frequently, and publicly, to touch base with our supporters and to attract new folks who want to help our mission here.  I have a vague memory of the exchange you reference, but ot a specific one.  It was not a threat, literally isn’t a threat, it was not addressed to anyone in particular, was part of a broader conversation referencing certain persons who apparently spend a lot of time slandering me and World Aid Runners on TikTok and other platforms, and plainly was not meant literally and was not interpreted as such by any other person but you.  <u><strong>Perhaps you are not an American or a native English speaker</strong></u>, because if you are then you would likely recognize the saying as a common phrase in our culture that anyone in the West knows is not something that is literal. </p>
                    <p>I would never engage in violence against any person except to defend myself or others from physical attack.  Violence is totally at odds with my personal beliefs and that of World Aid Runners, and that should be evident from the investment that I and we have made in the humanitarian work we do and where we do it.  Nothing I say, EVER, should be interpreted as a threat of violence, and no one that knows me or is familiar with our organization would ever think that. </p>
                    <p id="01"><u><strong>Your request for tax return information is inappropriate and contrary to American custom, basic corporate practices, and law.</strong></u>  Access to tax returns is restricted, for obvious reasons, by American law, and is not sought in the ordinary course for this reason.  Tax returns contain significant personal identifying information that is highly sensitive and can be used to gain access to information protected by law and to harass people.  The disclosure of tax returns and the information contained therein and thereon is extremely inappropriate and not something that is requested or obtained in the ordinary course in the West.</p>
                    <p id="02">We are regulated by the Attorney General’s Office of the State of New Mexico, under whose laws we are registered, pursuant to their laws.  If there is some complaint about our organization, or any non-profit organized under New Mexican law, there is a mechanism to make such a complaint.  I suggest you consult the Attorney General’s website. WE COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE IS A CORE VALUE OF WORLD AID RUNNERS.  Any suggestion is to the contrary is simply factually false.  I and we are advised by professional accountants and lawyers where appropriate and <u><strong>we have an unofficial Board of Advisors and, legally, my co-founder and co-investor Will Waggoner is a practicing lawyer whose law office in Santa Fe, New Mexico is our registered legal address.</strong></u></p>
                    <p>We are a small group of private persons using our own money to do good and do not have the resources, staff, etc. that large organizations that receive institutional or government funding do and risk our lives to be and go where those groups generally do not.  As I stated in my prior email, which you ignored, the rigors of our work on the ground simply do not allow for me to promptly check much less respond to inquiries such as yours.  It was chance that I saw your initial email and, given the disconcerting nature of your tone and tenor, I wanted to respond to it right away. </p>
                    <p id="03">I am aware of certain persons slandering me, other people associated with World Aid Runners, and the org.  I do not know if you are affiliated with them, or are one of the persons who published publicly the false information that such people are providing, but <u><strong>if you are be advised that legal action is being considered</strong></u> against such persons and the legal remedies available may be pursued.  Legal counsel has been consulted to advise on the appropriate steps, in the event we are inclined to take them.</p>
                    <p>We’re just a bunch of people doing good and sacrificing a lot to do it, just because we believe in helping these people.  It’s 100% real, couldn’t be a scam as a matter of basic and logic, and surely isn’t.</p>
                    <p>If you identify yourself and your purpose, I’ll answer appropriate questions when I can, consistent with our mission.</p>
                    <p>I have not carefully edited this correspondence for typos or other mistakes because I am in a war zone and cannot do so under the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Regards, <br>Ben Dusing <br>World Aid Runners, Inc. <br>Co-Founder and Director</p>

                <p>Dear sir/madam:</p>
                <p>Thank you for your recent email to the WAR website email.  I am currently in country.  We are a small, grass roots organization generally funded by me, with some support from a small group of private donors.  We don't have full time admin staff and are based in Kherson in the "red zone" at the front, where the intensity of the theatre and unreliable comms present additonal challenges.  There are often long delays in attending to emails, especially when I am in country.  I check the email very irregularly, as we have very little correspondence send to the email address.  The nature of our frontline work and extreme forward location make attending to administrative correspondence a secondary priority that must generally wait until we are no longer in-country and in a position to address it.  </p>
                <p id="05"><u><strong>We do not respond to correspondence that is anonymous, for legal and other security reasons.  So, first, you will need to identify yourself</strong></u> and a verifiable identity before I can respond, as a matter of policy.  So please do so, and I will endeavor to address your request, as far as I understand it.</p>
                <p>Thank you for your correspondence.</p>
                <p>Regards, <br>Ben Dusing <br>Co-Founder and Director<br> WAR</p>
