              <p><strong>John Henson</strong>: Please do not lose the fact that yall are challenigng a bunch of old rich lawyers with nothing better to do than to protect the people of kherson. I hope you are a lawyer.</p>
              <p><strong>Ian Umney:</strong> The fact is that they/you haven't filed the annual returns to the IRS, nor made attempts to respond to attmepts to request these documents.</p>
              <p><strong>Ian Umney: </strong>But you trying to intimidate people by making a list of those who are asking queastions is very odd.</p>
              <p><strong>John Henson: </strong>You do not know the laws for the 501c3 reporting. All required reports are available now, find them dear sleuth. You do lok soooo old today.</p>
              <p><strong>John Henson: </strong>If it sounds threatening, listen to your instincts. You are on "the list" now for sure. Only 1 way [off] that list. Stick with the truth. No rumour, no innuendo, truth with facts.  </p>
              <p><strong>Ian Umney: </strong>Where are these reports available to find? You must tell me clearly where I can find them. Otherwise, this statement is unlawful.</p>
