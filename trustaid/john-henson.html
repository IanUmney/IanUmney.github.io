            <strong>Chilling Free Speech & Public Accountability </strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Charities exist for public benefit and are expected to be transparent and open to scrutiny.</li>
              <li>Creating a list of critics, especially if linked to threats of legal action, can intimidate whistleblowers, donors, or journalists.</li>
              <li>This undermines public trust and could deter people from asking legitimate questions or reporting wrongdoing.</li>

            <strong>Legal Risk for Retaliation</strong>
            <p>If the charity retaliates against whistleblowers or critics (e.g., former staff, donors, or journalists), it may violate:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Whistleblower protection laws</li>
              <li>Defamation or anti-SLAPP laws (which protect individuals from strategic lawsuits intended to silence them)</li>

            <strong>Defamation and Libel</strong>
            <p>To prove defamation (specifically libel if written, or slander if spoken), the statement must be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>False – The accusation is not true.</li>
              <li>Published or communicated – It was shared with someone other than the person it’s about.</li>
              <li>Harmful – It damages the person’s reputation, career, or safety.</li>
              <li>Made negligently or maliciously – The speaker knew or should have known it was false or acted recklessly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="warn">Accusations of pedophilia or child trafficking are considered defamation per se, meaning harm is presumed — the victim doesn’t need to prove specific damage (e.g., lost income or reputation), because the claim is so severe and inherently damaging.</p>
