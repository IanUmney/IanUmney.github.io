            <h2>1. False Claims About Tax Return Disclosure</h2>
            <p class="quote">"Your request for tax return information is inappropriate and contrary to American custom, basic corporate practices, and law."</p>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>
            <p>This is <strong>factually and legally incorrect</strong>. Under IRS Code §6104, all tax-exempt nonprofits are legally required to provide their three most recent Form 990s and their IRS determination letter upon request, without requiring the requester to identify themselves.</p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Potential Violation</strong> Failure to provide Form 990s upon request is a federal compliance violation and can be reported to the IRS and state attorney general.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Misrepresentation of Legal and Governance Structures</h2>
            <p class="quote">"...unofficial Board of Advisors and, legally, my co-founder and co-investor Will Waggoner is a practicing lawyer whose law office in Santa Fe, New Mexico is our registered legal address."</p>
            <p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A “co-investor” in a nonprofit raises red flags—nonprofits cannot have investors. That term implies a financial stake, which contradicts the foundational principles of a tax-exempt entity.</li>
                    <li>The mention of a practicing attorney also being a co-founder and registered address might raise conflict-of-interest or transparency concerns, depending on the structure.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Potential Violation</strong> While not necessarily illegal on its own, this phrasing suggests misunderstanding or misrepresentation of nonprofit governance, which could be problematic for IRS or state scrutiny.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Implying Retaliation or Legal Threats to Suppress Transparency</h2>
            <p class="quote">"...if you are [involved with critics] be advised that legal action is being considered..."</p>
            <p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
            <p>Implying legal retaliation in response to lawful inquiries (like asking for public tax documents) may be seen as an attempt to intimidate or chill legitimate oversight. It's especially inappropriate for a public-benefit §.</p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Potential Violation</strong> This isn’t illegal per se, but it is deeply troubling and could be seen as hostile to public accountability, which contradicts the obligations of a public charity.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Culturally Insensitive Language</h2>
            <p class="quote">"...Perhaps you are not an American or a native English speaker..."</p>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>
            <p>This is <strong>inappropriate</strong>, <strong>offensive</strong>, and has <strong>no place</strong> in official correspondence from a nonprofit leader. It risks alienating donors, partners, or watchdogs and could seriously damage credibility.</p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Implication</strong>: Not illegal, but ethically and professionally unacceptable for a public-facing figure.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Failure to File and Disclose Required Tax Returns (Form 990-PF)</h2>
            <p>The organisation insists that providing tax return information is inappropriate, unlawful, and not standard practice in the West. This is legally false.</p>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>
            <p>Although World Aid Runners is registered, public databases (including IRS.gov, ProPublica, and Guidestar) show no Form 990-PF filings, despite their legal obligation to file annually if they are operating as a private foundation.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, they deny requests for these documents, claiming the information is too sensitive to disclose. However, under IRS Code §6104, all private foundations must publicly provide their three most recent Form 990-PFs upon request, with no requirement for the requester to identify themselves.</p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Violation: </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Failure to file Form 990-PF with the IRS is a compliance breach that can trigger penalties, revocation of tax-exempt status, and regulatory investigations.</li>
                    <li>Failure to disclose filed documents upon request is a federal violation and may be reported directly to the IRS using Form 13909 (Tax-Exempt Organization Complaint Form).</li>
                </ul>
