                <p>Benjamin G. Dusing is a <a href="https://linknky.com/news/2024/09/30/kentucky-supreme-court-suspends-ben-dusing/">suspended attorney</a> and the co-founder 
                    of World Aid Runners (WAR), a U.S.-registered nonprofit organization providing frontline humanitarian assistance in Ukraine. He currently serves as the organization's Director of Humanitarian Operations. 
                    Dusing has made multiple trips to Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, initially assisting refugees at the Polish-Ukrainian border and later focusing efforts in Kherson, a city severely impacted by the conflict.
                     There, he co-founded WAR alongside attorney William J. Waggoner and field coordinator <a href="#JG">John W. Gardner</a>. <a href="/trustaid/john-henson.html">John Henson</a> is also a large donor, and has performed an <em>"forensic analysis"</em> of the World Aid Runner accounts</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Misconduct:</strong> Dusing engaged in aggressive, disruptive, and threatening behavior during two family court cases (one with his ex-wife and another with a former partner).</li>
                <li><strong>Facebook Video:</strong> In 2021, Dusing posted a profane, threatening video targeting a judge’s staff attorney and opposing counsel, which the court found highly inappropriate and disruptive to the judicial process.</li>
                <li><strong>Bribery Allegation:</strong> He was found to have directed his co-counsel to offer a psychologist $5,000 to modify a custody evaluation, a serious ethical violation.</li>
                <li><strong>Frivolous Legal Tactics:</strong> Dusing filed numerous baseless motions, appeals, and complaints, many aimed at disrupting proceedings or intimidating other participants.</li>

        <h2>Continued Use of Law Email Address Despite Suspension</h2>
        <p>
          In September 2024, the <a href="https://linknky.com/news/2024/09/30/kentucky-supreme-court-suspends-ben-dusing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kentucky Supreme Court suspended Ben Dusing from practicing law for three years</a> due to multiple violations of professional conduct, including threatening behavior and attempts to influence custody evaluations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March 2025, the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2025/2025-Ohio-1334.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ohio Supreme Court imposed a reciprocal three-year suspension</a>, prohibiting him from practicing law in Ohio until reinstated in Kentucky.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these suspensions, Dusing has continued to use his law firm email address (<code>ben@dusinglaw.com</code>) in communications.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one instance, he responded to an email exchange between the IRS and a requester of Form 990-PF documents, using this email address.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, his email footer stated that he does not use this address; however, he continues to utilize it to correspond with and, at times, intimidate members of the public with threats of legal action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such conduct raises concerns about compliance with the terms of his suspension and the ethical implications of misrepresenting his professional status.

            <h3>1. False Claims About Tax Return Disclosure</h3>
            <p class="quote">"Your request for tax return information is inappropriate and contrary to American custom, basic corporate practices, and law."</p>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>
            <p>This is <strong>factually and legally incorrect</strong>. Under IRS Code §6104, all tax-exempt nonprofits are legally required to provide their three most recent Form 990s and their IRS determination letter upon request, without requiring the requester to identify themselves.</p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Potential Violation</strong> Failure to provide Form 990s upon request is a federal compliance violation and can be reported to the IRS and state attorney general.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>2. Misrepresentation of Legal and Governance Structures</h3>
            <p class="quote">"...unofficial Board of Advisors and, legally, my co-founder and co-investor Will Waggoner is a practicing lawyer whose law office in Santa Fe, New Mexico is our registered legal address."</p>
            <p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A “co-investor” in a nonprofit raises red flags—nonprofits cannot have investors. That term implies a financial stake, which contradicts the foundational principles of a tax-exempt entity.</li>
                    <li>The mention of a practicing attorney also being a co-founder and registered address might raise conflict-of-interest or transparency concerns, depending on the structure.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Potential Violation</strong> While not necessarily illegal on its own, this phrasing suggests misunderstanding or misrepresentation of nonprofit governance, which could be problematic for IRS or state scrutiny.</p>

            <h3>3. Implying Retaliation or Legal Threats to Suppress Transparency</h3>
            <p class="quote">"...if you are [involved with critics] be advised that legal action is being considered..."</p>
            <p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
            <p>Implying legal retaliation in response to lawful inquiries (like asking for public tax documents) may be seen as an attempt to intimidate or chill legitimate oversight. It's especially inappropriate for a public-benefit §.</p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Potential Violation</strong> This isn’t illegal per se, but it is deeply troubling and could be seen as hostile to public accountability, which contradicts the obligations of a public charity.</p>

            <h3>4. Culturally Insensitive Language</h3>
            <p class="quote">"...Perhaps you are not an American or a native English speaker..."</p>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>
            <p>This is <strong>inappropriate</strong>, <strong>offensive</strong>, and has <strong>no place</strong> in official correspondence from a nonprofit leader. It risks alienating donors, partners, or watchdogs and could seriously damage credibility.</p>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Implication</strong>: Not illegal, but ethically and professionally unacceptable for a public-facing figure.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>5. Failure to File and Disclose Required Tax Returns (Form 990-PF)</h3>
            <p>The organisation insists that providing tax return information is inappropriate, unlawful, and not standard practice in the West. This is legally false.</p>
            <p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>
            <p>Although World Aid Runners is registered, public databases (including IRS.gov, ProPublica, and Guidestar) show no Form 990-PF filings, despite their legal obligation to file annually if they are operating as a private foundation.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, they deny requests for these documents, claiming the information is too sensitive to disclose. However, under IRS Code §6104, all private foundations must publicly provide their three most recent Form 990-PFs upon request, with no requirement for the requester to identify themselves.</p>
            <section class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Violation: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Failure to file Form 990-PF with the IRS is a compliance breach that can trigger penalties, revocation of tax-exempt status, and regulatory investigations.</li>
                        <li>Failure to disclose filed documents upon request is a federal violation and may be reported directly to the IRS using Form 13909 (Tax-Exempt Organization Complaint Form).</li>
