    <h1>TrustAid BOFFIN</h1>
    <p>Blockchain-Oriented Funding for International Needs (BOFFIN) is my project, aimed at providing scalable, technologically driven solutions to the operational and logistical challenges faced in humanitarian aid.</p>
    <p>The goal is to ensure that the public can track every penny of their donation and guarantee it reaches those who need it most. </p>
    <p>The next six months will be dedicated to research, testing, implementation, and, ultimately, the delivery of the blockchain system for use by the general public. </p>

    <p>This page will be regularly updated with relevant information.</p>

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Billions are donated, but trust is low due to lack of visibility.</li>
        <li>Many people fear their money won’t reach the cause.</li>
        <li>War zones like Ukraine make transparency even harder.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>A public, blockchain-powered ledger that records every donation, milestone, and proof of impact — in real time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Donations in any currency</li>
        <li>Transparent campaign tracking</li>
        <li>Immutable, verifiable audit trail</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h4>1. You Donate</h4>
          <p>Using our payment portal</p>
          <p>On payment, you create a smart contract with the blockchain with the parameters you set.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h4>2. Blockchain Record</h4>
          <p>Every donation is logged on the blockchain and is tamper-proof.</p>
          <p>Because it is decentralised, anyone can view it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h4>3. Upload Proof</h4>
          <p>Photos, receipts, and reports are stored via IPFS.</p>
          <p>This ensures users can always access it, and tampering is clearly visible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h4>4. Track Impact</h4>
          <p>Donors can see the results in real time.</p>
          <p>As a trusted person, you can also help to verify data on the blockchain.</p>
          <p></p>
