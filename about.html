                <p>I was born in the north of England in '93 and moved to the south towards the end of the decade.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My family and I moved to New Zealand in 2000, Australia in 2005, and Germany in 2008.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I returned to the UK in 2011 and bounced around from place to job until traveling around Europe in 2015.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 2016, I travelled to Ukraine and met my wife. We married in 2019 and welcomed my son Jonathan later that year.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We lived in Ukraine until the Russian invasion in 2022 where, after being out of the country at the time, had to rescue them from their hometown.</p>
                <br><p>I blogged my journey on TikTok and went globally viral during the first days of the war.</p>
